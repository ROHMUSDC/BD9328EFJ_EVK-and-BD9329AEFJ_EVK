### Description: 
* The BD9328EFJ is a synchronous step-down switching regulator with built-in two low-resistance N-Channel MOSFETs. 
* This IC can supply continuous output current of 2A over a wide input range, and provides not only fast transient response, but also easy phase compensation because of current mode control. 
* The BD9329AEFJ is similar to the BD9328EFJ in package and functionality; however, has a higher max output current limit of 3A.
